# My Website

This is my first time making a website that others can see and not just me. My code knowledge for HTML5 is greater than my knowledge for CSS as I am taking a class for them at the moment. All this website will be is to put all my knowledge onto something in which it can be shared with others to see how much I have learned.

I plan on having several projects on this website in which they are simple things. I also plan to learn other types of code languages to help improve this website.
That is all for now!
