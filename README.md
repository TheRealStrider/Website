# My Website

This is my first time making a website that others can see and not just me. My code knowledge for HTML5 and CSS is far greater than JavaScript. All this website will be is to put all my knowledge into something that can be shared with others to see how much I have learned.

I plan on having several projects on this website ranging from small projects to bigger projects. I also plan to learn other types of programming languages to help improve this website.
That is all for now!
