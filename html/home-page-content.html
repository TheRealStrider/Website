    <h2>Welcome to Strider Studios!</h2>
    <p>Hello there traveller! Welcome to a website showcasing all the things I have made throughout the years. My goal
        is to have fun creating things others can enjoy. This can be as simple as a mod for Minecraft to a game that you
        can play. This website alone is a project for me and a way to show what I have done for others to see. Can't
        wait for you to see the projects, go ahead and check them out!</p>
